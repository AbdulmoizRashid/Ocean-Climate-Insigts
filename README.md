# Ocean Climate Insights Dashboard (2015–2023)

This project presents a visual dashboard that analyzes key marine climate indicators between 2015 and 2023. It highlights ocean temperature trends, pH levels, marine heatwave events, and coral bleaching severity using real world climate data.

## Dashboard Features

-  **Sea Surface Temperature Trends**
  Showing the trends of the SST.

-  **Coral Bleaching Severity Over Time**  
  Tracks average coral bleaching severity levels across years.

- **Marine Heatwave Event Counts**  
  Displays the number of marine heatwave events detected each year.

- **SST (Sea Surface Temperature) vs pH Level**  
  Shows the relationship between ocean temperature and acidity.

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- Google Colab
- Numpy
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib


##  About

This project was built as a way to visually explore and communicate marine climate patterns using Python and open source tools. It’s great for educational purposes, climate data storytelling.
